This is the pogTeam's CTFs records system. Here we manage our progress, checking which categories we are best and which we are worse. We also have an individual progress index. All with lots of charts, graphs and other things we copy from internet for free :)

This project uses flask_appbuilder and quickcharts2 as the base.
